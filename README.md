c. Release their movies between the months of October and November. The amount of money movies make between these two months has proved to be higher.

d. Set up its movie studio to have structures similar to those in IMAX, Newmarket Film Group and Universal. Since these studios have a higher revenue in the box office Microsot company should employ a similar design to these studios.
